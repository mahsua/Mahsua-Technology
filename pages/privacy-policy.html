            <h2>1. Our Commitment and Scope</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>Mahsua Technology</strong> (referred to as "Mahsua," "we," "us," or "our"), a core division of <strong>Mahsua India</strong>, is committed to our vision of making technology simple, affordable, and accessible while upholding the highest standards of data protection.
            </p>

            <p>
                This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which we collect, use, maintain, and disclose information collected from clients (schools, businesses, etc.) and end-users (students, parents, and employees) through our digital services, including the <strong>Mahsua Result Portal</strong>, custom applications, websites, and digital consulting services (collectively, the "Service").
            </p>

            <p>
                By using any part of our Service, you confirm your understanding and agreement to the terms outlined in this policy.

            <h2>5. Data Security Measures</h2>

            <p>Mahsua Technology is committed to protecting your data. In line with industry best practices, we implement robust security practices:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: outside; padding-left: 2.5rem;">
                <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We only process the data strictly necessary to provide the Service.</li>
                <li><strong>Encryption at Rest and in Transit:</strong> All sensitive data is stored using advanced encryption and transmitted over secure protocols (HTTPS/SSL) to prevent interception.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> We enforce the principle of least privilege, meaning access to Personal Data is limited strictly to Mahsua employees who require it to perform their job duties (e.g., technical support and deployment).</li>
                <li><strong>Data Segregation:</strong> Client data is logically separated within our systems to ensure data from one client cannot be accessed by another.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>6. User Responsibility for Data Protection</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>ATTENTION USERS AND CLIENTS:</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                While Mahsua Technology takes comprehensive measures to secure the platform and the data entrusted to us, **data security is a shared responsibility.**
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>
                    Mahsua Technology will not be responsible or held liable for the loss or unauthorized disclosure of any Personal Data resulting from a user's or client's decision to willingly share their login credentials, passwords, enrollment details, or any other authentication information with family members, friends, or any unauthorized third party.
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Users are strictly responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their access credentials and for all activities that occur under their account. Sharing this information compromises the security measures we have put in place and voids our responsibility for any subsequent data leakage or misuse.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h2>7. Disclosure of Information</h2>

            <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent Personal Data to third parties. We disclose information only as necessary and under strict confidentiality agreements:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: outside; padding-left: 2.5rem;">
                <li><strong>To the Data Controller:</strong> All end-user data (student, employee, etc.) is fully accessible to the client organization (the school or business) that provided it.</li>
                <li><strong>To Sub-processors (Vendors):</strong> We may use trusted third-party service providers (e.g., cloud hosting, database management) to assist us in operating our Service. These third parties are contractually bound to process data only on our instructions and to maintain confidentiality and security standards equal to or greater than our own.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> When required by law, subpoena, or government request to cooperate with legal proceedings or to protect our rights or the safety of others.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>

            <h2>8. Data Retention and Your Rights</h2>

            <h3>A. Data Retention</h3>
            <p>
                We will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and as strictly required by the client agreement with the respective organization. Upon termination of a client contract, we adhere to the client’s instructions regarding the secure deletion or return of their data.
            </p>

            <h3>B. Exercising Your Rights</h3>
            <p>
                To exercise your right to access, rectify, erase, or object to the processing of your Personal Data (especially academic results), you must first directly contact the <strong>Data Controller</strong> (the school or organization) that provided us with your data. We will fully cooperate with the client to fulfill any verified requests within the legal timelines.
            </p>

            <hr>
